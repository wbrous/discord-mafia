"""Turn management for Mafia game discussions and votes.

This module contains TurnManager, the central type for advancing the
state of the game.  It orchestrates:

- **Discussion rounds**: speaker ordering with an LLM-driven priority queue
  that analyses each message to decide who should respond next.
- **Voting**: parallel AI + human voting via Discord select menus, with
  timeouts and automatic failure tracking (modkill after two failures).
- **AI context**: maintains per-AI-player chat history and sends completions
  via the OpenAI SDK.
- **Human turns**: grants and revokes Discord send-message permissions to
  enforce turn-taking for human players equivalent to AI players.
