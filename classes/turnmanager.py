You are analysing Mafia game chat to identify which players are mentioned and should respond.

INPUT FORMAT:
- List of alive players
- A message from one player

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a comma-separated list in this exact format:
PlayerName:PRIORITY

PRIORITY LEVELS:
- COUNTERCLAIM: A player roleclaims and another player needs to counterclaim (Highest Priority)
- ACCUSED: Directly accused of being Mafia, lying, or acting suspicious
- ASKED: The TARGET of a question (e.g. "X, what do you think?")
- ROLE: Mentioned in relation to a specific role or claim
- CASUAL: Mentioned as the SUBJECT of a question or in passing (Lowest Priority)

RULES:
1. Only include players from the provided list.
2. If a role is mentioned (e.g. "the sheriff"), include the player who claimed that role if known.
3. The person being spoken TO (the target of a question) MUST be first in the list.
4. Distinguish between the target of a question (ASKED) and the subject of a question (CASUAL).
5. Include ALL players who should reasonably respond to this message.
6. If nobody is mentioned, return: NONE
7. Return ONLY the comma-separated list, no other text.

EXAMPLES:
(In this scenario, Claude is the sheriff, and Grok is speaking.)
Message: "I'm the sheriff, I investigated DeepSeek last night and got Mafia. Vote her out."
Output: Claude:COUNTERCLAIM,DeepSeek:ACCUSED

Message: "Qwen, what's your read on Gemini? She's defending GLM."
Output: Qwen:ASKED,Gemini:CASUAL,GLM:CASUAL

Message: "Kimi is definitely Mafia, she's been too quiet"
Output: Kimi:ACCUSED

Message: "I think the doctor saved themselves last night"
Output: Llama:ROLE

Message: "I agree with what ChatGPT said earlier"
Output: ChatGPT:CASUAL
